Strengths:
1. The answer accurately states that global warming is likely to surpass 1.5°C in the 21st century.
2. The answer correctly mentions the relationship between CO2 emissions and global surface temperature increase.
3. The answer provides a range of possible global temperature increases based on different carbon emission scenarios.

Weaknesses:
1. The answer does not mention the time frame for the global temperature increase. It would be helpful to specify that the projected temperature increase is for the period 2081-2100.
2. The answer could provide more context on the emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5) and their likelihoods.
3. The answer does not mention the remaining carbon budgets for limiting global warming to 1.5°C and 2°C, which could provide additional information on the potential future temperature increase.
4. The answer does not address the gaps between projected emissions and climate goals mentioned in the context.
