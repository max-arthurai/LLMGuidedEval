Strengths:
- The answer provides a clear explanation of the expected temperature increase in the near term and for the 2081-2100 period based on different GHG emissions scenarios.
- It acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the exact magnitude of warming.
- It highlights the importance of reducing non-CO2 emissions in limiting temperature increase.

Weaknesses:
- The answer could have provided more specific information on the projected temperature increase in the near term (2021-2040).
- It does not mention the possibility of global warming reaching or exceeding 1.5°C even under the very low GHG emission scenario.
- The answer does not mention the remaining carbon budgets for limiting global warming to 1.5°C and 2°C, which were provided in the context.
