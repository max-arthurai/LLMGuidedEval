Strengths:
- The answer provides a clear and concise summary of what scientists predict will happen this century regarding global warming and climate change risks.
- The answer accurately reflects the information provided in the context.
- The answer includes specific details such as the time frame (2021-2040) and the potential impact of greenhouse gas emissions reductions.

Weaknesses:
- The answer could be improved by including more specific information about the projected impacts of global warming, such as the potential consequences for ecosystems, sea levels, and extreme weather events.
- The answer does not mention the potential consequences of climate change beyond the near term (2021-2040), which limits the overall understanding of the long-term impacts.
- The answer could benefit from providing a brief explanation of the acronyms used (e.g., GHG, SSP) for clarity.
