Strengths:
- The answer provides a clear and concise summary of what scientists think will happen this century.
- It accurately mentions that global warming will continue to increase in the near term and is likely to reach 1.5°C.
- It correctly states that climate change risks will become more complex and difficult to manage with further warming.

Weaknesses:
- The answer could be improved by providing more specific information about the time frame in which global warming is expected to reach 1.5°C and the potential consequences of reaching that threshold.
- It would be beneficial to include information about the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on global warming and the need for reductions in emissions to mitigate the effects.
- The answer could also benefit from providing more context or citing specific sources to support the statements made.
