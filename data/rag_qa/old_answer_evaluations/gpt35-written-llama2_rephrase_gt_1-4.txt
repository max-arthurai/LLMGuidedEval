Strengths:
- The answer clearly explains that a change of just a few degrees in the average global temperature can lead to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events.
- The answer mentions the potential consequences of these extreme weather events, such as illness, mortality, displacement, and the upheaval of communities.
- The answer highlights the impact of rising sea levels on coastal areas.

Weaknesses:
- The answer could provide more specific examples or evidence to support the claim that extreme weather events will increase. This would make the explanation more convincing.
- The answer could also mention the potential economic impacts of extreme weather events, as they can lead to significant financial losses.
- The answer does not explicitly mention the impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity, which are also important considerations when discussing the consequences of global temperature change.
