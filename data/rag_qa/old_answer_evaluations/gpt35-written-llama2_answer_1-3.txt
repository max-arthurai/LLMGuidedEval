Strengths:
1. The answer provides a clear and concise summary of the information provided.
2. It accurately states that the Earth's temperature is expected to continue rising in the near term due to increased CO2 emissions.
3. It includes the best estimate of global warming for 2081-2100 based on different GHG emissions scenarios.
4. It acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding these projections.
5. It mentions the importance of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change.

Weaknesses:
1. The answer could provide more specific information about the projected temperature increase for the near term (2021-2040). While it mentions that global warming is "more likely than not" to reach 1.5Â°C, it does not provide a specific range or estimate for this period.
2. It does not mention the specific sources or reports from which the information is derived, making it difficult for the reader to verify the accuracy of the answer.
3. The answer could benefit from providing more context on why reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change is important in limiting the temperature increase.
