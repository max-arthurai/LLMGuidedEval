Strengths:
- The answer accurately states that a few degrees of global warming can lead to an increase in extreme weather events like heatwaves, storms, and droughts.
- The answer mentions the adverse impacts of these extreme events, including sickness, death, and displacement of people from their homes.
- The answer correctly highlights the impact of rising sea levels on coastal cities.

Weaknesses:
- The answer could provide more specific examples or evidence to support the claims made. For example, mentioning specific studies or statistics on the increase in extreme weather events or the number of people affected by rising sea levels would strengthen the answer.
- The answer does not mention the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and biodiversity, which are also important reasons to be concerned about a change in global temperature.
- The answer does not mention the potential economic costs and disruptions that can arise from extreme weather events and sea level rise. Including this aspect would provide a more comprehensive answer.
