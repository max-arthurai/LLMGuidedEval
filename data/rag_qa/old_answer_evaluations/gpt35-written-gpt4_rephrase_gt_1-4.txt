Strengths:
- The answer provides a clear explanation of the potential impacts of a few degrees increase in global temperature.
- It highlights the connection between temperature increase and extreme weather events, such as intense heat, storms, and drought.
- It mentions the potential consequences of these events, including illness, mortality, and displacement of populations.
- It mentions the impact of sea level rise on coastal cities.

Weaknesses:
- The answer could benefit from providing more specific examples or evidence to support the claims made.
- It does not mention the impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity, which are also important considerations when discussing the effects of temperature increase.
- The answer could be improved by explaining the underlying mechanisms behind the projected impacts, such as the relationship between temperature increase and the frequency or intensity of extreme events.
- The answer could also mention the potential economic and social consequences of these impacts.
