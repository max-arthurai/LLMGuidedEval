Strengths:
1. The answer provides a clear and concise summary of the evidence that the climate is changing due to human activities.
2. The answer includes specific data points and statistics to support each piece of evidence, which adds credibility to the response.
3. The answer correctly highlights the various aspects of climate change, such as rising temperatures, sea levels, greenhouse gas levels, and changes in extreme events.

Weaknesses:
1. The answer could benefit from a more organized structure, such as presenting each piece of evidence in a separate paragraph for better readability.
2. While the answer mentions the role of greenhouse gas emissions in causing climate change, it does not explicitly state that human activities are responsible for these emissions.
3. The answer could provide more context on the sources of greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on the climate system.
