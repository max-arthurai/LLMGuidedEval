Strengths:
- The answer accurately states that human activities, specifically the emission of greenhouse gases, are causing global warming.
- The answer mentions the specific increase in global surface temperature and the time period in which it occurred.
- The answer acknowledges that greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise and highlights the unequal contributions from different sources.
- The answer mentions the observed transformations in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere.
- The answer correctly states that the impacts of climate change are already visible in weather and climate extremes.

Weaknesses:
- The answer does not mention specific evidence for climate change, such as increases in greenhouse gas concentrations, sea level rise, or changes in extreme weather events.
- The answer does not provide specific details or data to support the claims made.
- The answer could benefit from providing more specific information about the observed changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere.
