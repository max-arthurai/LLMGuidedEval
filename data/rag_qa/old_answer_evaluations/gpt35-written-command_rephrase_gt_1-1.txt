Strengths:
- The answer accurately summarizes the main points from the given context.
- It mentions the best estimate of a 1.5Â°C rise in global temperatures in the near term and the potential hazards and risks associated with it.
- It acknowledges the potential for deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the impacts of global warming.

Weaknesses:
- The answer does not explicitly mention the time frame of "this century," which is specified in the question.
- It could have provided more specific details or examples about the potential risks and impacts of climate change.
- The answer could have mentioned the different greenhouse gas emission scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5) and their corresponding temperature estimates.
