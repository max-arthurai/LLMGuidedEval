Strengths:
- The answer accurately identifies some key pieces of evidence for climate change, including the rise in global mean sea level, the increase in the rate of sea level rise, and the observed changes in extreme events.
- The mention of the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and the resulting increase in global surface temperature is also relevant evidence.

Weaknesses:
- The answer could be strengthened by providing more specific details or examples of observed changes in extreme events, such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones.
- It would also be beneficial to mention the historical cumulative net CO2 emissions and the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, as mentioned in the provided context. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the evidence for climate change.
