Strengths:
- The answer accurately states that human activities, particularly the release of greenhouse gases, have caused global warming.
- The answer correctly mentions that global surface temperature has risen by 1.1Â°C above pre-industrial levels.
- The answer acknowledges that greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase and identifies unsustainable energy use, land use, land-use change, and consumption and production patterns as contributing factors.
- The answer correctly states that these factors have resulted in unequal historical and ongoing contributions to climate change.
- The answer acknowledges that climate change caused by humans has impacted various aspects of the Earth's systems, including the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere.
- The answer mentions that climate change has led to changes in weather and climate extremes globally.

Weaknesses:
- The answer could provide more specific evidence to support the claims made. For example, it could mention specific greenhouse gases and their concentrations, as well as specific observed changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and other systems.
- The answer does not mention the time frame of the observed changes, which could be helpful in understanding the urgency of addressing climate change.
- The answer could benefit from using more precise language when referring to the impacts of climate change, such as specifying the types of weather and climate extremes that
