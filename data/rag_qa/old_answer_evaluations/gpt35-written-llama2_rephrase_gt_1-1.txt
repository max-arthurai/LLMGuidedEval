Strengths:
- The answer accurately captures the main points mentioned in the given context, such as the projected increase in global temperatures, the amplification of hazards with each rise in temperature, and the potential for significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to slow down global warming.
- The answer provides a clear and concise summary of the information.

Weaknesses:
- The answer could benefit from more specific and precise language. For example, instead of saying "near future," it would be more accurate to say "in the near term (2021-2040)" as mentioned in the context.
- The answer does not explicitly mention the risks associated with increasing global warming, such as climate-driven food insecurity and supply instability, as stated in the context. Adding this information would provide a more comprehensive answer.
- The answer does not directly address the question of what scientists think will happen this century. It focuses more on the projected increase in global temperatures and the potential impacts of climate change.
