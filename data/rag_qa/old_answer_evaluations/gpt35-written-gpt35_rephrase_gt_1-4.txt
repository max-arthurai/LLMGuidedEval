Strengths:
- The answer accurately states that a rise in global temperature of a few degrees can lead to an increase in extreme weather events such as heatwaves, storms, and droughts.
- It correctly mentions that these events can result in illness, fatalities, and displacement of people.
- The answer acknowledges that sea level rise will have a significant impact on coastal cities.

Weaknesses:
- The answer does not provide any specific evidence or references to support its claims. It would be stronger if it cited specific scientific studies or reports.
- It does not mention the impacts on food security, ecosystems, and biodiversity, which are also important concerns related to a few degrees of warming.
- The answer could benefit from providing more context on the global scale of these impacts and the long-term consequences.
