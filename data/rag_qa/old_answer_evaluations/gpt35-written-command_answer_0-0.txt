Strengths:
1. The answer provides specific evidence of climate change, such as the increase in global mean sea level and the rates of sea level rise over different periods.
2. The answer acknowledges human influence as the main driver of these changes since at least 1971.

Weaknesses:
1. The answer does not mention other evidence of climate change, such as the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and observed changes in extreme weather events.
2. The answer does not provide any context or reference to the source of the information, making it difficult to verify the accuracy and reliability of the evidence presented.
