The answer provided is accurate and covers the main evidence of climate change. It mentions the observed increase in global surface temperature, the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, the rise in sea levels, and the occurrence of extreme weather events. These are all important indicators of climate change. However, it could be strengthened by providing specific data or statistics to support each piece of evidence mentioned, such as the actual increase in global surface temperature or the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Adding these details would make the answer more precise and informative.
