Strengths:
- The answer provides a specific temperature increase estimate of up to 4.4°C by the end of the 21st century under a very high GHG emissions scenario.
- The answer is concise and directly addresses the question.

Weaknesses:
- The answer does not mention the lower end of the temperature increase range, which could be misleading. It would be more accurate to mention that the temperature increase could range from 1.4°C to 4.4°C depending on the emissions scenario.
- The answer does not mention the likelihood or probability associated with the temperature increase estimate. Including this information would provide a more complete understanding of the potential temperature increase.
