Strengths:
- The answer accurately states that human activities, particularly the release of greenhouse gases, have caused global warming.
- It correctly mentions the increase in global surface temperature and the continued rise in greenhouse gas emissions.
- It acknowledges the imbalanced contributions of different activities and regions to greenhouse gas emissions.
- The answer correctly states that significant changes have been observed in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere.
- It mentions the intensification of weather and climate extremes as a result of human-induced climate change.

Weaknesses:
- The answer does not provide specific evidence to support the claims made. It would be helpful to include specific observations or data points to strengthen the argument.
- The answer could provide more context on the sources of greenhouse gas emissions and their impacts on climate change.
- It could also mention additional evidence such as the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and sea level rise.
