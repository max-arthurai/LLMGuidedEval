Strengths:
- The answer provides a clear summary of the projected increase in global temperature by the end of the 21st century.
- It accurately states the relationship between CO2 emissions and global temperature increase.
- It mentions the range of warming projected by computer simulations and acknowledges that it depends on the level of carbon emissions.

Weaknesses:
- The answer does not mention the "near term" projections of global warming, specifically that it is likely to reach 1.5째C even under the very low GHG emission scenario and likely to exceed 1.5째C under higher emissions scenarios.
- The answer does not mention the remaining carbon budgets for limiting global warming to 1.5째C and 2째C, which could provide additional context.
- The answer does not address the policies and laws addressing mitigation and their potential impact on future temperature increase.
