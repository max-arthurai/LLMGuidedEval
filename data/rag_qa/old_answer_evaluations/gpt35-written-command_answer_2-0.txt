The answer provided is partially correct. It mentions the increase in the rate of sea level rise between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing between 2006 and 2018, which is evidence of climate change. However, it does not mention other evidence such as the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, historical cumulative net CO2 emissions, and observed changes in extremes like heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones. Including these additional pieces of evidence would strengthen the answer.
