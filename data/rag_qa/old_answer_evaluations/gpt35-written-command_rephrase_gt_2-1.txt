Strengths:
- The answer accurately states that continued greenhouse gas emissions will result in increasing global warming.
- The answer correctly mentions that every increment of global warming will intensify multiple and concurrent hazards.
- The answer highlights the potential benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including a slowdown in global warming and changes in atmospheric composition.

Weaknesses:
- The answer could provide more specific information about the estimated time when the level of global warming of 1.5°C is reached and when it is projected to decline back below 1.5°C.
- The answer could include more details about the potential impacts of climate change risks, such as climate-driven food insecurity and supply instability.
- The answer does not explicitly mention the increasing complexity and difficulty in managing climate change risks as further warming occurs.
