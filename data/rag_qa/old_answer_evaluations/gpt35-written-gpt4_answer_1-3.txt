Strengths:
- The answer accurately reflects the information provided in the context.
- It provides a range of possible temperature increases, indicating the uncertainty associated with different GHG emissions scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The answer could be more specific by mentioning that the range of temperature increase refers to the period from 2081-2100.
- It does not mention the specific emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5) associated with the temperature ranges.
- The answer does not address the time frame of "near term" (2021-2040) mentioned in the context.
- It does not mention the likelihood of exceeding 1.5Â°C under higher emissions scenarios.
