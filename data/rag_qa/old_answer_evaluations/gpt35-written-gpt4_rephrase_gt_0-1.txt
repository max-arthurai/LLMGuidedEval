Strengths:
- The answer accurately states that persistent greenhouse gas emissions will lead to increasing global warming.
- The answer correctly mentions that reaching 1.5°C of global warming is likely in the near term under most emission scenarios.
- The answer acknowledges that every degree of global warming will intensify multiple hazards.
- The answer correctly states that climate change risks will become increasingly complex and difficult to manage with further warming.

Weaknesses:
- The answer could be more specific about the time frame of "the foreseeable future" and "the near term" when referring to reaching 1.5°C of global warming.
- The answer could provide more specific examples of the multiple and concurrent hazards that will intensify with global warming.
- The answer could elaborate on the compounding risks and provide more examples of how climate-driven food insecurity and supply instability will interact with non-climatic risk drivers.
- The answer could mention the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate these impacts.
