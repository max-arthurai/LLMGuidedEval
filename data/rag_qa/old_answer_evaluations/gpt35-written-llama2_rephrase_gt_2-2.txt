Strengths:
- The answer acknowledges the importance of achieving net zero carbon emissions to mitigate global warming.
- It mentions transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power as a key strategy to achieve net zero emissions.
- It recognizes the need to decrease emissions from primary pollutants like coal, oil, and gas.
- It mentions that the rate of adaptation may vary across industries.

Weaknesses:
- The answer does not mention the need for deep reductions in other greenhouse gas emissions, such as methane.
- It does not discuss the role of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in achieving net negative CO2 emissions.
- There is no mention of the potential impact of reaching net zero GHG emissions on global surface temperatures.
- It does not mention the importance of energy conservation and efficiency in achieving net zero CO2 energy systems.
- The answer does not discuss the feasibility of adaptation options and the need for infrastructure resilience in the face of climate change.
