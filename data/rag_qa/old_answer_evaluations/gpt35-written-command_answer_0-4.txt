Strengths:
- The answer accurately states that risks and impacts of climate change increase with global warming.
- It mentions that the risks are higher at 1.5°C and even higher at 2°C, which aligns with the information provided in the context.

Weaknesses:
- The answer is quite brief and does not provide any additional details or explanations.
- It does not mention the reasons for concern, such as observed impacts, improved process understanding, and new knowledge on exposure and vulnerability.
- The answer does not address the long-term consequences beyond 2°C of warming or the impacts on coastal ecosystems, people, and infrastructure.
- It does not mention the increased occurrence of extreme heat events, climate-related diseases, mental health challenges, displacement, and other regional changes.
- The answer could benefit from providing a more comprehensive and detailed explanation of why a few degrees of change in average global temperature should be a concern.
