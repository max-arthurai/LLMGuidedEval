Strengths:
- The answer provides a range of possible temperature increases (1.5°C to 4.4°C) by the end of the 21st century.
- It acknowledges that the temperature increase depends on emissions scenarios and modelled pathways.

Weaknesses:
- The answer does not mention that the best estimate for the temperature increase is 1.4°C to 2.7°C for the period of 2081-2100.
- It does not mention the likelihood of reaching different temperature thresholds (e.g., 1.5°C or 2°C) based on carbon budgets.
- The answer does not provide any context or explanation for the emissions scenarios and modelled pathways.
- It does not mention the potential consequences or impacts of the temperature increase.
- The answer does not reference the specific sources or reports from which the information is derived.
