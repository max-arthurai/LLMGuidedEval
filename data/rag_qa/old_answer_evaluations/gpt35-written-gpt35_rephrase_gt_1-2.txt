Strengths: 
1. The answer correctly identifies the key strategy to mitigate global warming, which is achieving net zero carbon emissions.
2. The answer mentions the shift towards renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, as a means to achieve this goal.
3. The answer acknowledges that different industries may face varying challenges in adopting net-zero emission practices.

Weaknesses:
1. The answer does not mention the importance of reducing other greenhouse gas emissions, such as methane, in addition to carbon emissions.
2. The answer does not mention the need for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies to achieve net negative CO2 emissions.
3. The answer does not mention the potential decline in global surface temperatures that may occur if sustained net zero GHG emissions are achieved.
4. The answer does not address the question directly and does not provide a clear yes or no answer to whether we can slow down global warming.
