Strengths:
- The answer provides specific temperature ranges for different GHG emissions scenarios, which shows an understanding of the topic.
- The answer acknowledges that the figures given are best estimates and that the actual warming could fall within a range, showing an understanding of uncertainty in climate projections.

Weaknesses:
- The answer does not mention the time frame of "near term" (2021-2040) mentioned in the context, which could be helpful for providing a clearer understanding of when these temperature increases may occur.
- The answer does not mention the likelihood of reaching these temperature increases, as stated in the context ("more likely than not" for 1.5째C under SSP1-1.9 and "likely or very likely" to exceed 1.5째C under higher emissions scenarios). Including this information would provide a more complete picture of the potential temperature changes.
- The answer does not mention the remaining carbon budgets for limiting global warming to 1.5째C and 2째C, as mentioned in the context. Including this information would provide additional context for the potential future temperature increases.
