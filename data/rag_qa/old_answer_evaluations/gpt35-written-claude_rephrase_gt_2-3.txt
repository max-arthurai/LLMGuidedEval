Strengths:
- The answer correctly states that global temperatures will likely surpass 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels during this century.
- It accurately mentions the relationship between carbon dioxide emissions and global surface temperatures.
- The answer acknowledges that the range of warming depends on different emissions trajectories.

Weaknesses:
- The answer does not mention the timeframe for when global temperatures could reach the projected warming levels.
- It does not provide information on the likelihood of exceeding different warming thresholds.
- The answer could benefit from referencing the specific information from the provided context, such as the best estimates of warming for different emissions scenarios.
