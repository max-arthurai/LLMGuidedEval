Strengths:
- The answer acknowledges that efforts to reduce the impacts of global warming are being made.
- It provides a clear explanation of the relationship between CO2 emissions and global surface temperature increase.
- It mentions that the range of global warming depends on different emission scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The answer does not mention the time frame in which the Earth's temperature is expected to surpass 1.5°C.
- It does not mention the likelihood of reaching different temperature thresholds (e.g., 50% likelihood of limiting warming to 1.5°C).
- There is no mention of the remaining carbon budgets for different temperature targets.
