Strengths:
- The answer accurately conveys that uninterrupted greenhouse gas emissions will lead to increasing global warming.
- The answer correctly states that there is a best estimate of reaching 1.5째C in the near term, according to considered scenarios and modelled pathways.
- The answer mentions that each increment of global warming will intensify multiple and concurrent hazards.
- The answer correctly mentions that deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can lead to a discernible slowdown in global warming within around two decades.

Weaknesses:
- The answer does not mention that the predicted increase of 1.5째C is more likely than not to happen even under the very low emissions scenario, and likely or very likely to exceed 1.5째C under higher emissions scenarios.
- The answer does not mention that global warming may decline back to below 1.5째C by the end of the 21st century in some scenarios and modelled pathways.
- The answer does not mention the assessed range of warming for 2081-2100 under different emissions scenarios.
- The answer does not mention the compounding risks and cascading effects that will occur with further warming, including climate-driven food insecurity and supply instability.
