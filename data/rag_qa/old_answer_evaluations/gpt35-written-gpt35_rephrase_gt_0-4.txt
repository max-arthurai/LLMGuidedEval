Strengths:
1. The answer effectively highlights the potential consequences of a rise in global temperature, including extreme weather events, illness, loss of life, displacement, and impacts on coastal areas.
2. The answer provides a clear and concise explanation of why even a small change in average global temperature can be concerning.

Weaknesses:
1. The answer does not provide any specific evidence or references to support the claims made about the potential consequences of global temperature rise. Adding references or specific examples would enhance the credibility of the answer.
2. The answer could provide more specific information about the projected impacts of a few degrees of warming, such as the increased frequency of extreme heatwaves, storms, and droughts, as mentioned in the context provided.
3. The answer could also mention the risks and adverse impacts on human and natural systems, as well as the limits to adaptation and the potential exacerbation of existing vulnerabilities. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of why a change in average global temperature is a cause for concern.
