Strengths:
- The answer acknowledges that global warming is expected to continue and that the Earth will get hotter.
- It provides information on the relationship between CO2 emissions and temperature increase.
- It mentions the range of temperature increase estimates based on different emissions scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The answer does not specify the time frame for the temperature increase. The question asks about how much hotter the Earth is "possibly going to get," which implies a future timeframe.
- The answer does not mention the specific actions being taken to reduce global warming or the potential impact of those actions on temperature increase.
- The answer does not provide any context or explanation for the abbreviations or acronyms used, such as GtCO2, SSP, or NDCs, which may make it difficult for readers to fully understand the information presented.
