Strengths:
- The answer provides a clear and concise summary of what scientists believe will happen this century regarding global warming and climate change risks.
- It accurately mentions that global warming will continue to increase in the near term, even under low GHG emission scenarios.
- It highlights the potential for deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to slow down global warming within two decades.
- The answer correctly states that global warming may decline back to below 1.5째C in some scenarios by the end of the 21st century.
- It mentions the potential for global warming to reach up to 4.4째C if GHG emissions are very high.
- The answer acknowledges the increasing complexity and difficulty in managing climate change risks.

Weaknesses:
- The answer could provide more specific information about the timeframes for reaching certain levels of global warming (e.g., when 1.5째C is likely to be reached in the near term).
- It does not mention the significance of the 1.5째C threshold and its implications for climate impacts and adaptation efforts.
- The answer could provide more context on the sources of uncertainty and the limitations of the models and scenarios used in the scientific projections.
