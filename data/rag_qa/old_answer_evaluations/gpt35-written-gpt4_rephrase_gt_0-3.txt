Strengths:
1. The answer acknowledges that global warming is likely to exceed 1.5Â°C within the 21st century, even with optimistic mitigation efforts.
2. The answer includes the information about the relationship between CO2 emissions and global surface temperature increase.
3. The answer provides a range of potential global warming scenarios based on simulated scenarios.

Weaknesses:
1. The answer does not mention the time frame for reaching the different global warming scenarios.
2. The answer could benefit from including the context of the question, which mentions the time frame of 2021-2040.
3. The answer does not mention the impact of non-CO2 emissions on global warming scenarios.
