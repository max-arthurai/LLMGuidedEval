The answer provided is a comprehensive summary of what scientists think is going to happen this century based on the given context. It accurately communicates the main points:

- Global warming will continue to increase in the near term, with temperatures very likely to exceed 1.5°C under most emissions scenarios.
- By the end of the century, under very low emissions scenarios, global warming may decline back below 1.5°C. But under higher emissions scenarios, warming could reach 2.7-4.4°C by 2100.
- With further warming, climate change risks will become more complex and difficult to manage, with multiple climatic and non-climatic risks interacting and compounding overall risk.

The strengths of the answer include clear and concise language, as well as accurate representation of the main points. It effectively summarizes the information provided in the context.

One potential weakness of the answer is that it does not explicitly mention the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to slow down global warming and mitigate climate change risks. While this is implied in the context, it could be beneficial to specifically mention the need for deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

Overall, the answer provides a strong and accurate summary of what scientists think is going to happen this century based on the
