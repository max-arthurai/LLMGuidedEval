- It accurately states that global warming will continue to increase in the near term and that climate change risks will become more complex and difficult to manage.
- It correctly mentions the potential impact of deep emissions cuts on slowing the warming trend.

Weaknesses:
- The answer could benefit from providing more specific information about the different emissions scenarios and their corresponding temperature rise estimates for 2100.
- It could also mention that the assessed climate response to greenhouse gas emissions scenarios shows narrower uncertainty ranges compared to previous assessments.
- The answer does not explicitly mention the potential consequences of increasing global warming, such as impacts on ecosystems, sea-level rise, extreme weather events, etc.
