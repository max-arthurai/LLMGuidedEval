Strengths:
- The answer accurately states that reaching net zero CO2 and GHG emissions would result in a gradual decline in global surface temperatures.
- The answer correctly mentions that transitioning from fossil fuels without carbon capture and storage to low- or zero-carbon energy sources is necessary to reach net zero CO2 emissions.
- The answer includes the mention of demand-side measures, improving efficiency, reducing non-CO2 GHG emissions, and carbon dioxide removal as part of the solution.

Weaknesses:
- The answer does not mention the importance of limiting cumulative CO2 emissions and the need for strong reductions in other greenhouse gas emissions.
- The answer does not explain what net zero GHG emissions mean or why they are necessary.
- The answer could provide more specific information about the role of carbon dioxide removal in achieving net negative CO2 emissions.
- The answer does not acknowledge the need for adaptation options and infrastructure resilience in addressing global warming.
- The answer does not mention the feasibility of different mitigation options or the potential costs associated with emissions reductions.
