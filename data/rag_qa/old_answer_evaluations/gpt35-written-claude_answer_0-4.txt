Strengths:
- The answer provides a clear and concise summary of the reasons to be concerned about small changes in global average temperature.
- It accurately reflects the information provided in the context.

Weaknesses:
- The answer could benefit from providing more specific examples or evidence to support the points made. For example, providing statistics on the increase in mortality and morbidity from extreme heat events or the displacement of populations due to climate and weather extremes would strengthen the answer.
- The answer does not explicitly mention the limits to adaptation and the vulnerability of human and natural systems, which were mentioned in the context. Including this information would provide a more comprehensive answer.
