Strengths:
- The answer provides a clear explanation of the expected increase in Earth's temperature in the near term and by the end of the 21st century.
- It acknowledges the uncertainty of the projections and the influence of assumptions and models.
- It mentions the potential impact of efforts to reduce non-CO2 emissions on temperature change.

Weaknesses:
- The answer could benefit from including the specific information provided in the context, such as the range of global warming estimates for different emissions scenarios.
- It does not mention the specific carbon budgets for limiting global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C, which were provided in the context.
- The answer could be improved by mentioning the potential consequences or impacts of the projected temperature increases.
