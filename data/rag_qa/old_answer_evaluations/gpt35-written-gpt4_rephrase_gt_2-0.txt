Strengths:
- The answer accurately states that human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases, have caused global warming.
- It mentions the increase in global surface temperature and the continuing rise in greenhouse gas emissions.
- The answer acknowledges the disproportionate contributions to emissions from different sectors and regions.
- It mentions the observed changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere.

Weaknesses:
- The answer does not provide specific evidence to support the claim that climate change is already having an impact on numerous weather and climate extremes.
- It does not mention the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations or the historical cumulative emissions.
- The answer could benefit from including specific examples of observed changes and their attribution to human influence.
