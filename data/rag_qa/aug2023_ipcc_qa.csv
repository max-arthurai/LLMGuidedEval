0,What evidence is there that the climate is changing?,"A.1 Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally
caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850-1900

historical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and
land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions,
between and within countries, and among individuals (high confidence). {2.1, Figure 2.1,
Figure 2.2}
A.1.3 Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions
from human activities over this period. Historical cumulative net CO2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 were 2400 ± 240 GtCO2
of which more than half (58%) occurred between 1850 and 1989, and about 42% occurred between 1990 and 2019 (high
confidence). In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations (410 parts per million) were higher than at any time in at least 2
million years (high confidence), and concentrations of methane (1866 parts per billion) and nitrous oxide (332 parts per
billion) were higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years (very high confidence). {2.1.1, Figure 2.1}
A.2.1 It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Global mean sea level increased by
0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1] mm yr-1 between 1901
and 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing to 3.7 [3.2 to 4.2] mm yr-1
between 2006 and 2018 (high confidence). Human influence was very likely the main driver of these increases since at
least 1971. Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical
cyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human influence, has further strengthened since AR5. Human influence
has likely increased the chance of compound extreme events since the 1950s, including increases in the frequency of
concurrent heatwaves and droughts (high confidence). {2.1.2, Table 2.1, Figure 2.3, Figure 3.4} (Figure SPM.1)","Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020.

- Global surface temperature has increased by 1.1°C above 1850-1900 levels in 2011-2020. 

- Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase due to human activities like unsustainable energy use, land use changes, lifestyles and consumption/production patterns.

- Concentrations of greenhouse gases like CO2, methane and nitrous oxide are at their highest levels in at least hundreds of thousands of years.

- It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. 

- Global mean sea level has increased between 1901 and 2018. The rate of sea level rise has increased over this period.

- Changes in extremes like heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones can be attributed to human influence. 

- Human influence has likely increased the chance of compound extreme weather events like concurrent heatwaves and droughts.

The changes are evident in rising temperatures, sea levels, greenhouse gas levels, and shifts in extreme events.","Human actions, especially through releasing greenhouse gases, have clearly led to global warming, with the average surface temperature of Earth rising 1.1°C above 1850-1900 levels during 2011-2020. Emissions of greenhouse gases worldwide keep going up, with unequal past and present contributions coming from unsustainable energy usage, land use and land-use changes, lifestyles and consumption/production patterns across regions, between and within nations, and among people.

Human influence has been the main driver of these increases since at least 1971.","The activities of humans, specifically the release of greenhouse gases, have caused global warming. There is no doubt about this fact, as the global surface temperature has risen 1.1°C above 1850-1900 in 2011-2020.

The effects of human-caused climate change are evident in the widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere. These changes are affecting weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe.","There are several lines of evidence that indicate the climate is changing. Firstly, global temperatures have been rising steadily over the past century, with the last decade being the warmest on record. This warming trend is largely driven by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and other land-use changes, which release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, leading to an increase in the Earth's average temperature.

Secondly, the concentration of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere has been increasing steadily over the past few centuries, primarily due to human activities. The increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations is particularly notable, with a rise from about 280 parts per million (ppm) in the preindustrial era to over 410 ppm today. This increase is largely due to fossil fuel burning and land-use changes, and it is unequivocally linked to human activities.

Thirdly, the Earth's oceans have also been warming, with the average sea level rising by about 0.20 meters between 1901 and 2018. This rise in sea level is primarily due to the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, as well as thermal expansion of seawater as it warms.

Finally, there is evidence of changes in weather and climate extremes, such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation events, droughts, and tropical cyclones. While these events are influenced by various natural factors, human-caused climate change has likely increased their frequency and severity in recent decades. For example, the chance of compound extreme events such as concurrent heatwaves and droughts has increased since the 1950s.

In summary, there are multiple lines of evidence that indicate the climate is changing, including rising global temperatures, increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, warming oceans, and changes in weather and climate extremes. These changes are primarily driven by human activities, and the scientific consensus is clear: human-caused climate change is real, and immediate action is needed to mitigate its impacts.","The warming of the planet, primarily brought about by human actions such as the emission of greenhouse gases, has indisputably led to an increase in global surface temperature of 1.1°C compared to the period of 1850-1900. This phenomenon has been observed during the years 2011-2020. The concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continues to rise, resulting from a variety of factors including energy consumption, land usage, and patterns of production and consumption that are not environmentally sustainable. These factors contribute to disparities in greenhouse gas emissions between different regions, countries, and individuals. The effects of climate change are evident in the rapid and widespread alterations occurring in the atmosphere, oceans, ice caps, and ecosystems worldwide. Climate change caused by humans is also responsible for numerous extreme weather events and climatic conditions in every region of the planet.","There are several lines of evidence that indicate the climate is changing. These include:

1. Rising global temperatures: The average global temperature has risen by 1.1°C since the late 1800s, and the 20 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1985.
2. Increasing greenhouse gas emissions: The concentration of carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas, has increased by about 40% since preindustrial times, primarily due to fossil fuel burning and land use changes. Other greenhouse gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, have also increased due to human activities.
3. Sea level rise: Global mean sea level has risen by 0.20 meters between 1901 and 2018, with an accelerating trend in recent decades.
4. Changes in precipitation and weather patterns: There is evidence of changes in precipitation patterns, such as more intense and frequent heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall events.
5. Increase in extreme weather events: Human influence has likely increased the chance of compound extreme events, such as concurrent heatwaves and droughts, since the 1950s.
6. Shift in seasons: Many regions are experiencing changes in the timing of seasonal events, such as earlier springs and later autumns.
7. Ocean acidification: The increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide has led to ocean acidification, which can have negative impacts on marine ecosystems.

These changes are consistent with the expected effects of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and are supported by multiple lines of evidence from observations, paleoclimate records, and climate models.","The Earth's temperature has risen significantly due to human activities, primarily the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This warming trend is evident in the increase of global surface temperature, which has reached a startling 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels (1850-1900) in the past decade (2011-2020). Unfortunately, greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise unabated, with a disproportionate impact resulting from unsustainable practices in energy consumption, land use, and production and consumption patterns. These emissions are contributing to widespread and swift changes in the environment, including the atmosphere, oceans, ice caps, and ecosystems. The consequences of human-induced climate change are already manifesting in various forms of extreme weather events across the planet.","There are several lines of evidence that indicate the climate is changing.

7. Ocean acidification: The increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide has led to ocean acidification, which can have negative impacts on marine ecosystems.

These changes are consistent with the expected effects of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and are unlikely to be explained by natural factors alone. The scientific consensus is that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are the dominant cause of these changes.","The phenomenon of global warming has been indubitably linked to human activities, primarily due to the emission of greenhouse gases.

1,What do scientists think is going to happen this century?,"B.1 Continued greenhouse gas emissions will lead to increasing global warming, with the best

CO2 emissions in nearly all considered scenarios and modelled pathways. In the near term, global warming is more
likely than not to reach 1.5°C even under the very low GHG emission scenario (SSP1-1.9) and likely or very likely to
exceed 1.5°C under higher emissions scenarios. In the considered scenarios and modelled pathways, the best estimates
of the time when the level of global warming of 1.5°C is reached lie in the near term29. Global warming declines back
to below 1.5°C by the end of the 21st century in some scenarios and modelled pathways (see B.7). The assessed
climate response to GHG emissions scenarios results in a best estimate of warming for 2081–2100 that spans a range
from 1.4°C for a very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9) to 2.7°C for an intermediate GHG emissions scenario
(SSP2-4.5) and 4.4°C for a very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5)30, with narrower uncertainty ranges31 than for
corresponding scenarios in AR5. {Cross-Section Boxes 1 and 2, 3.1.1, 3.3.4, Table 3.1, 4.3} (Box SPM.1)
B.2.3 With further warming, climate change risks will become increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Multiple
climatic and non-climatic risk drivers will interact, resulting in compounding overall risk and risks cascading across
sectors and regions. Climate-driven food insecurity and supply instability, for example, are projected to increase with
increasing global warming, interacting with non-climatic risk drivers such as competition for land between urban
expansion and food production, pandemics and conflict.

remaining carbon budget or the larger remaining carbon budget for the same level of temperature change41. {3.3.1}

emissions in 2030 implied by nationally determined contributions (NDCs) announced by October
2021 make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century and make it harder
to limit warming below 2°C. There are gaps between projected emissions from implemented

- Risks and adverse impacts from climate change escalate with every increment of warming. Even going from 1.5C to 2C of warming leads to significantly higher risks according to the report.

- Extreme heat events have already resulted in increased mortality and disease. These impacts are expected to get worse with additional warming. 

- Climate and weather extremes are already driving displacement of populations and disproportionately affecting small island states. Additional warming will exacerbate these issues.

- Every region is projected to experience multiple simultaneous changes in climate impact-drivers as temperatures rise further. This includes increases in extreme events like heatwaves, droughts, floods, storms, and wildfires.

- Small increases in global temperature are projected to lead to dramatic increases in extreme sea level events in coastal areas.

So in summary, the concern is that even incremental temperature rises amplify risks across many climate impact areas - from extreme weather to sea level rise to health impacts. The projected changes are likely to be very disruptive, especially for vulnerable populations. That's why limiting warming to 1.5C or 2C above pre-industrial levels","As global temperatures rise, our world faces intensifying threats. Even a slight uptick of a few degrees could unleash more ferocious heat waves, violent storms, and parched droughts. These calamitous conditions, amplified by the warming climate, will endanger lives, displace populations, and claim victims. Moreover, ascending sea levels, fueled by the heating planet, will overtake shoreline communities and inundate coastal cities. Though daunting, this future remains preventable if we act now to curb emissions and make our systems more resilient. By working together and pursuing innovation, we can still safeguard our collective wellbeing and that of generations to come.","Based on the context provided, there are a few key reasons to be concerned about even small changes in average global temperature:

- Risks and adverse impacts from climate change escalate with every increment of warming. Even going from 1.5C to 2C of warming leads to significantly higher risks according to the report.

- Extreme events like heatwaves, droughts, floods, and storms are projected to become more frequent and intense. Just a few degrees of warming will substantially increase the risks from these extreme events. 

- Impacts like sea level rise, species extinction, crop failures, spread of diseases, and human displacement are expected to be much worse with more warming. Even 1.5C to 2C can mean large differences in the severity of these impacts.

- Limits to adaptation are expected at lower temperature thresholds than previously thought. Just small amounts of additional warming may make it very difficult for humans and ecosystems to adapt.

- Compound extreme events and multiple climate changes occurring simultaneously are projected to become more common with further warming. The combined impacts will be worse than individual events.

So in summary, the report highlights that even small changes in global temperature will have significant and escalating impacts, which is why we should be","As global temperatures climb higher, our world faces intensified threats from severe weather like scorching heat, violent storms, and parched droughts. Even slight warming can worsen these hazardous conditions, which will bring more disease, fatalities, and displacement as people abandon unlivable homes across the globe. Moreover, ascending sea levels endanger populations in seaside metropolitan areas.","Based on the context provided, there are a few key reasons to be concerned about even small changes in average global temperature:

- Risks and adverse impacts from climate change escalate with every increment of warming. Impacts are higher at 1.5C warming compared to now, and even higher at 2C warming. This suggests even small temperature increases can have significant consequences. 

- Extreme heat events have already resulted in increased mortality and disease. These impacts are likely to get worse with additional warming.

- Climate and weather extremes are already driving displacement and disproportionately affecting small island states. Additional warming will exacerbate these issues. 

- Multiple climate impact-drivers are projected to occur concurrently with further warming (compound events). Even small amounts of additional warming could substantially increase the risks from these compound events.

- Extreme sea level events that currently happen once in 100 years are projected to occur annually in many locations with just 1-2°C of warming. This highlights the dramatic impacts even small temperature rises can have.

In summary, the context indicates we should be very concerned about temperature increases of just a few degrees, as the impacts escalate rapidly with each increment of warming. Even changes that seem small can have highly disruptive consequences globally.","As global temperatures rise, extreme weather such as heat waves, severe storms, and droughts are likely to become more frequent and intense. Even a slight warming of a few degrees could substantially worsen these hazardous events. The resulting impacts on human health and displacement would be far-reaching. Heightened rates of illness and mortality, as well as mass migration away from uninhabitable areas, would be seen across the globe. Additionally, accelerating sea level rise would profoundly disrupt communities situated along coastlines.  

In summary, the compounded dangers posed by more extreme weather, should the planet warm by several degrees, will jeopardize human security on a worldwide scale. From increased disease burdens to community disruption stemming from displacement, the risks to public welfare are immense and warrant urgent action.","Risks and projected adverse impacts and related losses and damages from climate change will escalate with every increment of global warming.

As stated in the passage, even a small increase in global warming can lead to significant and widespread consequences, such as increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events like heatwaves, droughts, floods, and storms. These events can cause loss of life, displacement, damage to infrastructure, and disruption of essential services, which can have far-reaching and devastating effects on human societies and ecosystems. Additionally, rising temperatures can also lead to rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and more frequent and intense wildfires, which can have catastrophic consequences for coastal communities, agriculture, and biodiversity.

Moreover, these impacts are not limited to the environment but also have significant social and economic implications. Climate change can exacerbate poverty, inequality, and social unrest, particularly in vulnerable regions, by disrupting food production, water resources, and economic activities. It's important to note that these impacts are already being observed and will continue to worsen over time unless greenhouse gas emissions are significantly reduced. Therefore, limiting global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C is critical to avoid the most severe impacts of climate change and protect the planet for future generations."," If the Earth's temperature increases by a few degrees, it is expected that there will be a surge in severe and life-threatening weather occurrences such as intense heatwaves, powerful storms, and prolonged droughts. These calamitous events, further exacerbated by global warming, will result in illnesses, fatalities, displacement of people, and immense destruction worldwide. Moreover, the continuous rise in sea levels will have a profound impact on the lives of individuals residing in coastal areas.","The concern about a change of just a few degrees in the average global temperature is due to the associated impacts and risks that come with it. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states, ""Climate change is a global problem that requires a global response."" The effects of climate change are already being felt, from rising sea levels to more intense and frequent heatwaves, droughts, and storms. These changes can have devastating consequences for human health, ecosystems, and economies.

A change of just a few degrees may seem small, but it can have significant and far-reaching impacts. For example, a warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, which is the target set by the Paris Agreement, could lead to catastrophic sea level rise, more frequent and severe heatwaves, and increased risk of water scarcity and food shortages. A 2°C increase would bring even more dire consequences, including widespread extinctions, irreversible damage to ecosystems, and significant economic losses.

Moreover, these impacts will not be felt equally by all populations. Vulnerable communities, including low-lying coastal areas, indigenous peoples, and those living in poverty, are already experiencing the effects of climate change. Rising temperatures and extreme weather events threaten their livelihoods, cultures, and very survival.

Therefore, limiting global warming to well below 2°C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels is critical to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change and ensure a sustainable future for all. This requires urgent and collective action from governments, businesses, and individuals worldwide to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to renewable energy sources."," If the Earth's temperature increases by a few degrees, it is likely that the frequency and severity of extreme weather occurrences, such as heatwaves, storms, and droughts, will also augment. This escalation, brought on by a relatively minor rise in global temperatures, has the potential to wreak havoc on human populations, leading to illness, mortality, displacement, and the upheaval of entire communities across the globe. Moreover, the continuous rise in sea levels will have a profound impact on the lives of those living in coastal areas."," The concern about a change of just a few degrees in the average global temperature is due to the potential severe impacts it can have on the environment, human health, and the economy. Even a small increase in global temperature can lead to more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, and storms, which can result in loss of life, damage to infrastructure, and displacement of people. Additionally, rising temperatures can cause sea levels to rise, leading to coastal erosion, flooding, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources. This can have devastating effects on agriculture, fisheries, and other industries, ultimately affecting the livelihoods of millions of people. Furthermore, the impacts of climate change are not limited to environmental factors, as they also have significant social and economic consequences, such as increased migration, conflict, and health issues.

It's important to note that the risks associated with climate change are not equally distributed, and the most vulnerable populations, including low-income communities, indigenous peoples, and small island nations, are often the ones most affected. Therefore, it's essential to address the root causes of climate change and work towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating its impacts, to ensure a sustainable future for all."," If the Earth's temperature increases by a few degrees, it is likely that we will witness an uptick in severe and hazardous weather occurrences such as heatwaves, tempests, and dry spells. These detrimental happenings, further aggravated by even a slight elevation in global temperatures, can have devastating consequences for human health, including loss of life, displacement, and widespread destruction. Moreover, the continuous rise in oceanic water levels will significantly affect the daily lives of those residing in coastal areas."
