Even with best-case scenario results from sustained mitigation over the course of the century, global warming will likely exceed 1.5째C during the 21st century. For every 1000 GtCO2 emitted by human activity, global surface temperature rises by 0.45째C. According to modelled scenarios, global warming could very well range from 2.7째C under intermediate levels of carbon emissions to 4.4째C under high levels of carbon emissions.
