Overall the way to slow down global warming is to reach net zero carbon emissions by transitioning large portions of society to renewable sources of energy (like solar and wind energy) while reducing the emissions of major pollutants like goal, oil, and gas. However, this will likely happen at a different pace in different industries. According to modelled projections, industries like land-use and forestry will be able to adapt to net-zero emissions practices more reasily than the construction and transportation industries.
