A.1 Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally
caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850-1900
in 2011-2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase, with unequal
historical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and
land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions,
between and within countries, and among individuals (high confidence). {2.1, Figure 2.1,
Figure 2.2}
A.1.3 Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions
from human activities over this period. Historical cumulative net CO2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 were 2400 ± 240 GtCO2
of which more than half (58%) occurred between 1850 and 1989, and about 42% occurred between 1990 and 2019 (high
confidence). In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations (410 parts per million) were higher than at any time in at least 2
million years (high confidence), and concentrations of methane (1866 parts per billion) and nitrous oxide (332 parts per
billion) were higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years (very high confidence). {2.1.1, Figure 2.1}
A.2.1 It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Global mean sea level increased by
0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1] mm yr-1 between 1901
and 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing to 3.7 [3.2 to 4.2] mm yr-1
between 2006 and 2018 (high confidence). Human influence was very likely the main driver of these increases since at
least 1971. Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical
cyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human influence, has further strengthened since AR5. Human influence
has likely increased the chance of compound extreme events since the 1950s, including increases in the frequency of
concurrent heatwaves and droughts (high confidence). {2.1.2, Table 2.1, Figure 2.3, Figure 3.4} (Figure SPM.1)
