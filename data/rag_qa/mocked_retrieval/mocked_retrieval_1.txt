B.1 Continued greenhouse gas emissions will lead to increasing global warming, with the best
estimate of reaching 1.5°C in the near term in considered scenarios and modelled pathways.
Every increment of global warming will intensify multiple and concurrent hazards (high
confidence). Deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions would
lead to a discernible slowdown in global warming within around two decades, and also
to discernible changes in atmospheric composition within a few years (high confidence).

B.1.1 Global warming28 will continue to increase in the near term (2021–2040) mainly due to increased cumulative
CO2 emissions in nearly all considered scenarios and modelled pathways. In the near term, global warming is more
likely than not to reach 1.5°C even under the very low GHG emission scenario (SSP1-1.9) and likely or very likely to
exceed 1.5°C under higher emissions scenarios. In the considered scenarios and modelled pathways, the best estimates
of the time when the level of global warming of 1.5°C is reached lie in the near term29. Global warming declines back
to below 1.5°C by the end of the 21st century in some scenarios and modelled pathways (see B.7). The assessed
climate response to GHG emissions scenarios results in a best estimate of warming for 2081–2100 that spans a range
from 1.4°C for a very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9) to 2.7°C for an intermediate GHG emissions scenario
(SSP2-4.5) and 4.4°C for a very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5)30, with narrower uncertainty ranges31 than for
corresponding scenarios in AR5. {Cross-Section Boxes 1 and 2, 3.1.1, 3.3.4, Table 3.1, 4.3} (Box SPM.1)
B.2.3 With further warming, climate change risks will become increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Multiple
climatic and non-climatic risk drivers will interact, resulting in compounding overall risk and risks cascading across
sectors and regions. Climate-driven food insecurity and supply instability, for example, are projected to increase with
increasing global warming, interacting with non-climatic risk drivers such as competition for land between urban
expansion and food production, pandemics and conflict. (high confidence) {3.1.2, 4.3, Figure 4.3}
