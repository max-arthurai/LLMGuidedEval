B.1.1 Global warming28 will continue to increase in the near term (2021–2040) mainly due to increased cumulative
CO2 emissions in nearly all considered scenarios and modelled pathways. In the near term, global warming is more
likely than not to reach 1.5°C even under the very low GHG emission scenario (SSP1-1.9) and likely or very likely to
exceed 1.5°C under higher emissions scenarios. In the considered scenarios and modelled pathways, the best estimates
of the time when the level of global warming of 1.5°C is reached lie in the near term29. Global warming declines back
to below 1.5°C by the end of the 21st century in some scenarios and modelled pathways (see B.7). The assessed
climate response to GHG emissions scenarios results in a best estimate of warming for 2081–2100 that spans a range
from 1.4°C for a very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9) to 2.7°C for an intermediate GHG emissions scenario
(SSP2-4.5) and 4.4°C for a very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5)30, with narrower uncertainty ranges31 than for
corresponding scenarios in AR5. {Cross-Section Boxes 1 and 2, 3.1.1, 3.3.4, Table 3.1, 4.3} (Box SPM.1)
B.5.2 For every 1000 GtCO2 emitted by human activity, global surface temperature rises by 0.45°C (best estimate, with a likely
range from 0.27°C to 0.63°C). The best estimates of the remaining carbon budgets from the beginning of 2020 are
500 GtCO2 for a 50% likelihood of limiting global warming to 1.5°C and 1150 GtCO2 for a 67% likelihood of limiting
warming to 2°C40. The stronger the reductions in non-CO2 emissions, the lower the resulting temperatures are for a given
remaining carbon budget or the larger remaining carbon budget for the same level of temperature change41. {3.3.1}
A.4 Policies and laws addressing mitigation have consistently expanded since AR5. Global GHG
emissions in 2030 implied by nationally determined contributions (NDCs) announced by October
2021 make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century and make it harder
to limit warming below 2°C. There are gaps between projected emissions from implemented
policies and those from NDCs and finance flows fall short of the levels needed to meet climate
goals across all sectors and regions. (high confidence) {2.2, 2.3, Figure 2.5, Table 2.2}
