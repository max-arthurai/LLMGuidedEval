 Here is my feedback on the summary:

Strengths:

- Concisely captures the main points from the article - the ratification of a new UPS union contract, key details like the 5-year duration, pay increases, and improved benefits.

- Highlights the most important outcomes - averting a potential strike, eliminating the two-tier wage system, increasing wages.

- Accurately states key statistics - 86.3% ratification vote, contract covers 340,000 workers.

- Good structure and flow moving from the overall ratification news to details of what the contract contains.

Weaknesses:

- Could provide more context upfront that this was a contract with the Teamsters union. 

- Leaves out some potentially important details like the additional paid holiday, end to forced overtime, and A/C in new trucks.

- No mention of how the contract could impact UPS' business costs and ability to compete with rivals like Amazon.

- Doesn't note the historically high ratification vote percentage.

Overall the summary covers the most essential information from the article in a clear and concise manner. A few additional details and context would help strengthen it further. But it succeeds in
