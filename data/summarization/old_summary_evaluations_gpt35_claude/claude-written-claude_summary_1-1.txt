 Here is my feedback on the summary:

Strengths:

- The summary accurately captures the key details from the article, including Idina Menzel parting ways with Scooter Braun, the context around other artists leaving Braun's management, and highlights about Menzel's successful career.

- It concisely summarizes the relevant information in just a few sentences, making it easy to quickly grasp the main points.

- The summary maintains an objective tone and does not include any unsupported opinions or analysis.

- The writing is clear and straightforward. The summary would likely be easy for a reader to comprehend.

Potential improvements:

- The summary could provide more context around why Menzel originally signed with Braun and why she is now leaving. This additional background would make the split more understandable.

- While the summary mentions Braun's joke on social media, it could explain the joke briefly for readers who are unfamiliar with the situation. 

- The last sentence about Menzel still being listed on Braun's website feels slightly out of place in the summary. This lesser detail could be trimmed.

- The summary could have a more concise opening sentence, jumping directly into the news of the split rather
