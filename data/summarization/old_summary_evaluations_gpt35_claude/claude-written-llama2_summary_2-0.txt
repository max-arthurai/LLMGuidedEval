 Here is my feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of the summary:

Strengths:

- Concisely captures the key points from the article, including the ratification of a new UPS contract, the terms of the deal, and the implications for UPS and the broader labor market.

- Clearly states the main outcome - UPS workers ratifying a new 5-year contract that eliminates the risk of a strike. 

- Highlights important details like pay raises, ending 2-tier wage system, added benefits, and the union's plans to use the deal to recruit Amazon workers.

- Good structure and flow, starting with the outcome then providing context and additional details.

Weaknesses:

- Could provide more context upfront on why the UPS negotiations were significant, including UPS' role in holiday deliveries and the economy.

- Leaves out some minor details from the article like the vote percentages and approval of local agreements. Not critical but provides additional context.

- The sentence about transportation unions' bargaining power is relevant but a bit disconnected from the overall summary.

- Some verbosity - the summary could be shortened by removing redundant phrases and tightening the language.

Overall, the summary covers the key points
