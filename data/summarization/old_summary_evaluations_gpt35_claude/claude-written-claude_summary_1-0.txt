 Here is my feedback on the summary:

Strengths:

- Effectively captures all the key points from the article in a concise manner. The length is appropriate for a summary.

- Clearly highlights the main news - ratification of a new UPS contract to avoid a strike. 

- Provides relevant context around the implications for the package delivery industry and companies like Amazon.

- Includes key statistics like the 86.3% ratification vote and how it was the highest ever for UPS. 

- Summarizes the most important terms of the deal like pay raises, elimination of two-tier wages, additional holiday, etc.

- Notes the parallels to UAW's talks with automakers regarding closing wage gaps. 

- Mentions UPS cutting forecasts due to higher expected labor costs, providing useful background.

Weaknesses:

- The summary does not mention when the new contract takes effect. Adding the duration of the 5-year deal would provide useful context.

- Could elaborate slightly more on the potential strike risk and how it could have disrupted deliveries during the crucial holiday season. 

Overall, this is a strong summary that highlights the most important details from the article concisely and accurately
