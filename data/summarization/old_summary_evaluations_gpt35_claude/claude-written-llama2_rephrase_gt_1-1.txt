 Here is my feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of this summary:

Strengths:

- The summary accurately captures the key details from the article - that Idina Menzel has parted ways with manager Scooter Braun, and this comes after several other celebrities have also split from Braun.

- It concisely summarizes the core information in just two sentences, without losing important context.

- The summary highlights Menzel's accomplishments and fame as a Broadway star and voice actress.

- It lists some of the other high-profile artists who have left Braun's management.

Weaknesses:

- The summary could provide more background on who Scooter Braun is, since he is not as well known as the musical acts he manages. 

- It could mention how long Menzel was represented by Braun before parting ways. This gives context on their working relationship.

- It does not note that Braun made a joke about the situation on social media, which provides his perspective.

- The summary could be improved by removing some names from the list of artists who left Braun and instead saying "several other celebrities." This would declutter the summary.

Overall, the summary accurately
