 Here is my feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of the summary:

Strengths:

- Captures the main news event concisely - that Idina Menzel has parted ways with manager Scooter Braun.

- Provides good context by mentioning this follows other artists like Demi Lovato and Justin Bieber recently leaving Braun's management.

- Includes some key details about Menzel's successful career as a Broadway star and pop singer.

Weaknesses: 

- Could be more concise by trimming some descriptive details about Menzel's career achievements. The key info is that she's an acclaimed actress/singer.

- Doesn't mention Scooter Braun's response on social media about no longer managing himself, which provides an interesting color to the story. 

- The list of other artists who have left Braun's company reads a bit like a laundry list. Could be shortened or woven more smoothly into the context.

Overall the summary hits the key news points but could be tightened up and made more engaging by pruning some lengthier details and incorporating Braun's reaction. The core info about Menzel and the context of other departures is solid.
