 Here is my feedback on the summary:

Strengths:

- The summary accurately captures the key details from the article - that Idina Menzel has parted ways with manager Scooter Braun, and this comes after other artists like Demi Lovato and Justin Bieber were reported to be leaving him as well. 

- It provides good context on who Idina Menzel is, highlighting her Broadway success and her fame from voicing Elsa in Frozen. This gives readers who may not be familiar with her some useful background.

- The summary is concise and stays focused on the main topic without going into too much extraneous detail.

Weaknesses:

- The summary could provide more context on who Scooter Braun is, since he is not as well known as the artists he manages. Adding a sentence on his background could be helpful.

- The last sentence about her recent roles feels a bit extraneous to the main topic of the
