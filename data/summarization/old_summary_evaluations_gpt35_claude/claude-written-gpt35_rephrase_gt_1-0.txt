 Here is my feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of the summary:

Strengths:
- Concisely captures the key points from the article, including the ratification of the 5-year UPS Teamsters contract, the 86.3% member approval rate, and the main terms like pay raises, eliminating two-tier wages, extra holiday, ending forced overtime, and AC in trucks.

- Accurately states the contract received the highest support ever for a Teamsters contract with UPS. 

- Notes the Teamsters' intent to use this as leverage with companies like Amazon.

Weaknesses:

- Could provide more context on why this contract was significant - UPS is largest private employer of union workers and could influence other labor negotiations.

- Leaves out some details like the specific wage increases and number of Teamster members covered.

- Doesn't mention UPS previously lowered financial projections due to labor costs during negotiations. 

- Could improve clarity by restructuring the last sentence about the Teamsters calling on other companies to take note.

Overall the key points are captured well and it provides a concise summary of the article's main themes and developments. Some additional context and details could make the summary more comprehensive.
