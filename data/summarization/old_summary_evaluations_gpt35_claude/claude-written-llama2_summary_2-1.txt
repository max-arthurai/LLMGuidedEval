 Here is my feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of the summary:

Strengths:

- Accurately captures the key facts - that Idina Menzel has parted ways with manager Scooter Braun, and this follows other celebrities like Demi Lovato leaving him as well.

- Concisely summarizes the relevant background details on Menzel - that she's a Tony-winning Broadway and pop star known for roles like Wicked and Frozen. 

- Notes that the reason for the split is not specified, showing that the summary is not making unsupported speculations.

- Mentions that Menzel is still listed on Braun's website, providing an additional relevant detail.

Weaknesses:

- Could provide more context on who Scooter Braun is, since he's not as well known as the celebrities he manages. 

- Doesn't mention the timeline of when Menzel first signed with Braun and when she left. This could give helpful framing.

- Leaves out some of Menzel's other achievements like her Hollywood Walk of Fame star and Emmy/Billboard award nominations. Not critical but provides more background.

- The writing could be tightened up in places, removing redundant phrases like
