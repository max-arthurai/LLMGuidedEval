The summary effectively captures the main points of the article. It highlights the disappearance of Neptune's clouds and the potential role of the sun's increased activity. It also mentions the correlation between solar activity and cloud cover on Neptune, as well as the possible explanation of UV light triggering chemical reactions in the planet's atmosphere. The summary is concise and provides a clear overview of the article. One minor improvement could be to include the mention of the source of the study, which is the journal Icarus.
