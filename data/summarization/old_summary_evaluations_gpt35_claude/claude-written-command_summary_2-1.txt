 Here is my feedback on the summary:

Strengths:

- The summary accurately captures the key details from the article - that Idina Menzel has parted ways with manager Scooter Braun, alongside several other artists like Demi Lovato and Justin Bieber. 

- It concisely summarizes the article in just a few sentences, distilling the essence of the report.

- The context about Menzel's Broadway and Frozen success is included to provide helpful background on who she is.

- The tone and language matches the original article.

Weaknesses:

- The summary could be improved by putting Menzel's split with Braun as the first sentence, since that is the main news being reported.

- While it mentions Braun's tweet, it could explain that tweet a bit more to make it clearer - that he was jokingly referring to the reports of artists leaving him.

- A couple extra details could be added for clarity, like noting the source is The Hollywood Reporter and when the split occurred (January 2022).

- The phrasing is a bit plain at times - some wording could be polished for concision and flow.

Overall, this is a strong summary
