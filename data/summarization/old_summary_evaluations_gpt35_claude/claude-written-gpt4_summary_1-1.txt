 Here is my feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of the summary:

Strengths:

- Accurately captures the key details from the article - that Idina Menzel has parted ways with manager Scooter Braun. 

- Provides good context by mentioning this comes amidst other artists like Demi Lovato also leaving Braun. This gives helpful background on the broader situation.

- Notes that despite the change, Menzel is still listed on Braun's website, providing an additional relevant detail.

- Concise and to the point at one paragraph. Doesn't include unnecessary details.

Weaknesses:

- Could provide more background on who Idina Menzel is, since she's likely not a household name. Explaining she's a Tony-winning Broadway star who voiced Elsa in Frozen would help give readers context.

- While it mentions the rumors of Bieber and Grande leaving, it could note that Braun's team denied the Bieber rumor specifically. Provides a fuller picture.

- The last sentence about the website isn't needed since it's somewhat repetitive of the first paragraph. That space could be used to provide more context instead.

Overall, the summary accurately captures the key details and
