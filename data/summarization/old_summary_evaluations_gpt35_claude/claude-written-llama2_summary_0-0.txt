- Notes the number of workers covered and the wide reach of UPS service.

- Mentions the potential impact a strike could have had on holiday deliveries.

- Includes the union leader's quote about setting a new standard and template for the industry. 

Weaknesses:

- Doesn't mention UPS cutting revenue/profitability targets due to higher labor costs during negotiations. This provides helpful context.

- The summary could be more concise - it's nearly as long as the article. Further editing could make it more succinct.
