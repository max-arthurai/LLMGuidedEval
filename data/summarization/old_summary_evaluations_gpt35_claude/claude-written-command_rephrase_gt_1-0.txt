 Here is my feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of the summary:

Strengths:

- Concisely captures the key details, including the 5-year contract length, 86.3% approval rate, pay increases, end of two-tier wage system, additional paid holiday, elimination of forced overtime, and A/C for trucks. 

- Accurately states the contract was ratified, eliminating the risk of a strike.

- Notes the Teamsters' intention to use the contract as leverage with nonunion companies like Amazon.

Weaknesses:

- Could provide more context around the contract negotiations being contentious, which led UPS to lower financial projections. 

- Doesn't mention the record high approval vote for a Teamsters contract at UPS. This helps highlight the significance.

- Leaves out some details like the specific wage increases, the remaining local agreement to be finalized, and pending votes from two other locals.

Overall, the summary hits the key points from the article concisely. Providing some additional context around the challenging negotiations and highlighting the record contract approval would make it a bit stronger. But it's a solid high-level summary of the UPS Teamsters contract approval and implications.
