 Here is my feedback on the summary:

Strengths:

- Captures the main points from the article concisely, including key details like the 5-year contract duration, 86.3% ratification vote, pay increases, elimination of two-tier wage system, additional paid holiday, end to forced overtime, and A/C in trucks.

- Accurately states the union's perspective that this contract sets a positive example for workers' rights and compensation that nonunion companies should follow. 

- Maintains a neutral tone consistent with a summary.

- Is concise at less than 150 words while still covering the key points.

Weaknesses:

- Could provide more context about UPS's significance as the largest private employer of unionized workers in the US. 

- Leaves out some minor details like the specific wage increases and the potential impact on UPS's revenue projections.

- Does not mention the rejected contract by FedEx pilots, which provides some relevant industry context.

- Could state the number of union members covered by the contract.

Overall, the summary efficiently captures the most important details from the article in a clear and neutral way. The only potential improvements would be adding a bit
