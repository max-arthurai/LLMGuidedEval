 Here is my feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of the summary:

Strengths:

- The summary accurately captures the main point of the article - that Idina Menzel has parted ways with manager Scooter Braun. 

- It provides good context by mentioning Menzel's accomplishments in theater and film, highlighting her as a highly regarded performer. 

- The summary lists some of the other major artists who have recently left Braun's management, providing useful context around the broader industry trend.

Weaknesses: 

- The summary could be more concise - it includes some extraneous details about Menzel's career that aren't directly relevant to the main focus.

- The wording around the other artists who left Braun's management is slightly unclear. The summary makes it sound like all those artists declared their departures this year, when in fact that context comes from the article itself, not the summary.

- The summary could provide more context around why the split between Menzel and Braun is notable or significant, beyond their respective accomplishments. 

Overall the key strengths are capturing the main focus and providing some useful context. With some tightening up of wording and removal of less relevant details, the summary could
