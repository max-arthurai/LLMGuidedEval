 Here is my feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of the summary:

Strengths:

- Captures the main news event - UPS workers ratifying a new contract.

- Highlights key details like the 5-year duration, pay raises, elimination of two-tier wage system, additional paid holiday, end to forced overtime, and AC in new trucks. 

- Notes the high ratification percentage of 86.3%.

- Mentions the number of workers covered (~340,000). 

- Explains the significance - removing risk of a strike that could have disrupted Christmas deliveries and increased shipping costs.

Weaknesses:

- Could provide more context around the contract negotiations and the union's bargaining power/leverage.

- Leaves out some minor details like the specific wage increases, the supplemental local agreements, and the upcoming votes.

- Doesn't mention UPS having to adjust financial projections due to higher labor costs.

Overall, the summary hits the key points and highlights the most essential information from the article in a concise manner. Providing some additional context around the contract negotiations and union leverage could make it slightly stronger. But it effectively distills the key event, terms, and significance within
