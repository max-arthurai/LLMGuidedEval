 Here is my feedback on the summary:

Strengths:

- Captures the main point that Python can now be used directly in Excel spreadsheets. This is the key new capability being introduced.

- Mentions that Python code will be executed in the cloud, highlighting the security aspect.

- Briefly explains who may benefit from this feature - data analysts, engineers, etc.

Weaknesses: 

- Does not mention that this is a preview release rather than general availability. The availability is noted in the article.

- Could provide more detail on how Python can be used - statistical analysis, visualization, machine learning etc. The capabilities are covered in the article.

- Does not highlight that popular Python data science libraries like Pandas and SciKit-Learn are supported. This additional context about libraries is in the article text.

Overall the summary accurately conveys the main points about Python in Excel in a concise manner. To make it more comprehensive, adding the preview status, capabilities overview, and notes about supported libraries would help supplement the information. But it succeeds in being a short, focused summary of the key announcement.
