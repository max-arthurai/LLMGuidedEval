 Here is my feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of the summary:

Strengths:

- Captures the key points from the article concisely, including the 5-year contract duration, pay increase details, elimination of two-tier wage system, additional paid holiday, end to forced overtime, and A/C in trucks.

- Notes the high approval rate of 86.3% voting in favor. 

- Mentions the difficult negotiations and heated rallies, providing context.

- Draws out the main implications - demonstrating the power of unions to achieve gains for workers, and the example this sets for non-union companies.

Weaknesses:

- Could provide more numeric details from the contract like the specific wage increases rather than just saying "pay increase."

- Doesn't mention UPS cutting revenue/profitability forecasts due to labor costs during negotiations. This provides helpful context.

- The last sentence about the implications for non-union companies like Amazon is a bit vague. Could be more specific about what those companies should pay attention to or learn from this.

- Lacks some key context about the contract applying to 340,000 UPS workers nationwide.

Overall the summary hits the key points and
