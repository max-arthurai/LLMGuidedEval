 Here is my feedback on the summary:

Strengths:

- The summary accurately captures the key facts from the article - that Idina Menzel has parted ways with manager Scooter Braun, and this follows several other artists recently leaving Braun's management.

- It concisely summarizes the core content in just two sentences.

- It identifies Idina Menzel as a renowned stage and screen actress, providing relevant context on who she is.

- The writing flows well and is free of grammatical errors.

Weaknesses: 

- The summary could provide more context on who Scooter Braun is, since he is not as well known as Idina Menzel. Describing him as a high-profile talent manager would help readers understand his significance.

- While it mentions other artists have left Braun's management, it does not specify that they are musicians. Stating they are "musical artists" would make this clearer.

- It could trim some detail, as the list of specific artists who have parted with Braun is not essential to the key focus.

Overall, the summary accurately captures the essence of the article in a concise manner. Providing a bit more
