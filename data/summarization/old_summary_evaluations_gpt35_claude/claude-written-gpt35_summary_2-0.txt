 Here is my feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of the summary:

Strengths:

- Accurately captures the main points from the article - the UPS workers ratifying a new 5-year contract that raises pay, eliminates the two-tier wage system, and provides additional benefits. 

- Highlights the key details like the 86.3% member approval of the deal and the implications it could have for setting industry standards and impacting companies like Amazon.

- Notes the elimination of the strike risk that could have disrupted Christmas deliveries and increased costs.

- Overall succinctly summarizes the key details from the lengthy article.

Weaknesses:

- Could provide more context upfront that this is a contract for UPS workers represented by the Teamsters union. 

- Leaves out some minor details like the specific wage increases and membership size covered.

- Doesn't capture some of the background like the enhanced union bargaining power currently.

- Could improve clarity on the local supplemental agreements.

Overall, the summary accurately captures the most important details and implications of the contract deal for UPS workers in a concise manner. Providing a bit more context and inclusion of some additional minor details could make it slightly
