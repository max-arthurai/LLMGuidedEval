 Here is my feedback on the summary:

Strengths:

- Accurately captures the key points of the article, including the ratification of the new UPS contract, the 86.3% member approval, and the main benefits like pay raises, eliminating two-tier wages, added holiday, ending forced overtime, and A/C in trucks.

- Concisely summarizes the lengthy article into a compact paragraph while still including important details.

- Notes the tumultuous contract negotiations and highlights the union's messaging about the contract being a template for other companies.

Weaknesses:

- Could provide more context on the implications, such as how this contract avoids a potential strike during the holidays and the impact on UPS' costs and revenue. 

- Doesn't mention the record approval percentage for a UPS contract or that it doubles raises for part-time workers.

- Leaves out some minor details like the total contract value, length of the contract, and number of affected workers.

Overall, the summary accurately captures the main points from the article in a concise manner. Providing some additional context and details could make it a bit stronger. But it's a solid summary of the key information.
