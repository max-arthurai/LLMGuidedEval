 Here is my feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of the summary:

Strengths:

- Accurately captures the main news that Idina Menzel has parted ways with manager Scooter Braun.

- Provides good context by mentioning Menzel's accomplishments as a Broadway star in "Wicked" and as the voice of Elsa in "Frozen." 

- Notes her major pop music success with the hit song "Let It Go" going 9x platinum.

- Situates this news within the broader context of other celebrities like Demi Lovato and Justin Bieber also leaving Braun's management company.

Weaknesses:

- Could provide more background on who Scooter Braun is, since he's not as well known as the musical artists. 

- Doesn't mention the timeline of when Menzel signed with Braun in 2019 and left in January 2022. This context about the short tenure would make the split seem more significant.

- Leaves out some key details from the article like Menzel's upcoming projects and accolades such as her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

- Doesn't summarize Braun's response to the controversy, which provided useful perspective.
