 Here is my feedback on the summary:

Strengths:

- Accurately captures the key details from the article - the ratification of a new UPS contract, pay raises, elimination of two-tier wage system, additional holiday, end to forced overtime, and AC in new trucks. 

- Concisely summarizes the main points in just a few sentences.

- Notes the high approval rate of 86.3% among voting members. 

- Mentions the potential strike risk that was avoided and possible impact on Christmas deliveries.

- Comments on the contract setting a new standard for the industry. 

Weaknesses:

- Could provide more context on why the contract negotiations were contentious, such as UPS trying to cut costs.

- Leaves out some minor details like the total number of UPS workers covered.

- Doesn't mention this was the highest approval vote ever for a Teamsters contract at UPS.

- Could explain the recruiting angle with Amazon in a bit more detail.

Overall, the summary accurately captures the key points from the article in a concise manner. Providing some additional context and details could make it a bit stronger. But it's a solid high-level
