 Here is my feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of the summary:

Strengths:

- Accurately captures the key details from the article - that Idina Menzel has parted ways with manager Scooter Braun.

- Provides good context by mentioning Menzel's famous role as Elsa in Frozen and hit song "Let It Go." This gives readers who may not know her background some useful context.

- Mentions the recent departures of other artists like Demi Lovato and J Balvin from Braun's management. This establishes a broader context.

- Notes that despite the departures, some artists still appear on Braun's website, providing an interesting detail.

- Concise and well-written in summarizing the key points.

Weaknesses:

- Could provide more context on why the departure is notable, given Braun's high-profile list of clients. 

- Leaves out some minor details like the rumors around Ariana Grande leaving and Braun's tweet about still managing himself. While minor, these points add some color.

- Doesn't capture Menzel's Broadway accomplishments and awards as well as it could. Her Tony wins and nominations are very relevant but
