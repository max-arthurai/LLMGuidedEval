 Here is my feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of the summary:

Strengths:

- Captures the main points of the article concisely, including key details like the 5-year duration of the contract, the 86.3% ratification vote, and notable improvements like pay increases, ending two-tier wages, added holiday, and A/C in trucks.

- Clearly conveys the UPS Teamsters successfully negotiated a new contract with significant improvements for workers. 

- Highlights the union's perspective that this contract should set a standard for worker pay and conditions more broadly.

- Overall the summary accurately distills the key details from the article in a concise and coherent manner.

Weaknesses:

- Could provide slightly more context upfront that this is a contract for UPS workers represented by the Teamsters union. 

- Does not mention this contract averted a potential strike, which provides useful context.

- Leaves out some minor details like the total number of workers covered and the endorsement from the Teamsters' president. But these are not critical to understanding the main points.

- The statement about non-union companies paying attention is more of an opinion/commentary than a key fact
