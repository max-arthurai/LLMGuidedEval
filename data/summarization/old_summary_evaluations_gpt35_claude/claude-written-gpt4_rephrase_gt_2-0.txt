 Here is my feedback on the summary:

Strengths:
- Concisely captures the key details, including the 5-year duration, 86.3% approval rate, and major contract terms like pay raises, ending two-tier wages, extra paid holiday, banning forced overtime, and adding A/C to trucks.

- Accurately conveys the union's positive sentiment about the contract terms and their belief it should influence other companies.

- Overall the summary efficiently distills the most important information from the article into a compact form.

Weaknesses: 
- While it notes the contract "enhances salaries", it lacks specific details about the pay increases mentioned in the article (ex: $2.75 more per hour in 2023, $7.50 over contract length). 

- It states the contract "abolishes the dual-tier wage structure" but doesn't explain what that means or why it's significant. 

- The summary could provide more context about the implications, such as reducing labor costs for UPS and potentially influencing contract negotiations at other companies.

- The phrasing around "non-union businesses should take note" is a bit vague and interpretive. Sticking closer to the article
