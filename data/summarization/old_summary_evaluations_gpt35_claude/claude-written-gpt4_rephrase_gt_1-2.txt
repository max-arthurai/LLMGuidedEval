 Here is my feedback on the summary:

Strengths:

- The summary accurately captures the main points from the article - that Python can now be used directly in Excel, enabling more advanced data analysis capabilities. 

- It highlights key details like the =PY function for entering Python code, Anaconda distribution being leveraged, and security measures like running in the cloud.

- It is concise at just 3 sentences while still covering the core announcements.

Weaknesses:

- The summary could provide slightly more context by mentioning this is a new public preview rather than making it sound like the functionality is fully launched. 

- It lacks some minor details like availability only for Insiders currently.

- The last sentence about it running in the cloud could be clarified to be Microsoft's cloud specifically.

Overall the summary effectively distills the key points from the article in a clear and succinct manner. The only potential improvements would be providing a bit more context around this being an initial preview and adding minor details currently omitted. But it succeeds at summarizing the core announcements well.
