 Here is my feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of the summary:

Strengths:

- Captures the main news clearly and concisely in the first sentence - that Idina Menzel has parted ways with manager Scooter Braun.

- Provides good context on the recent departures of other artists from Braun's management company, establishing this as part of a broader trend.

- Conveys some key details about Menzel's successful career and accolades.

Weaknesses: 

- The list of other departing artists could be shortened to the most relevant or biggest names.

- More context could be given on the significance of the split from Braun's perspective, given his status as a high-profile manager. 

- It lacks mention of the source of the news or any quotes/statements from representatives.

- Additional background on the partnership between Menzel and Braun, such as how long they worked together, would add useful context.

Overall the summary efficiently communicates the key news event and provides relevant context. With some additional details and tighter editing it could give a fuller picture. But it succeeds in being concise and hitting the highlights of this industry development.
