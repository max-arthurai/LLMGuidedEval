Aug 22 (Reuters) - U.S. workers at United Parcel Service (UPS.N) have ratified a new five-year contract, the Teamsters union said on Tuesday, closing the door on a potential strike that could have put timely Christmas deliveries in doubt and sent shipping costs soaring.

The deal raises pay and eliminates a two-tier wage system for drivers at Atlanta-based UPS, the world's largest package delivery company, which handles about a quarter of U.S. parcel deliveries and serves virtually every city and town in the nation. It also provides another paid holiday, ends forced overtime and adds air conditioning to new models of the company's ubiquitous brown trucks starting next year.

An overwhelming 86.3% of voting members chose to ratify the agreement that covers UPS workers in the U.S., of which there are about 340,000, according to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.

""The agreement passed by the highest vote for a contract in the history of the Teamsters at UPS,"" the union said. The Teamsters did not say what percentage of members voted.

General wage increases for part-time workers double the amount obtained in the previous UPS Teamsters contract - and existing part-time workers receive a 48% average total wage bump, addressing a key sticking point in talks, the union said.

Under the contract deal, current full- and part-time workers will get $2.75 more per hour in 2023, and $7.50 more per hour over the length of the contract, according to the Teamsters.

Ending seniority-based wage tiers that pay new hires less than veteran workers is also a central issue for the UAW-Detroit Three labor talks. UPS is the nation's largest private-sector employer of unionized workers and ending the labor cost-saving scheme there could be a big win for unions and a possible blow to companies.

Meanwhile, Teamsters General President Sean M. O'Brien has made no secret of his plan to use the UPS deal as a recruiting tool - especially for warehouse workers at Amazon.com (AMZN.O), the biggest customer at UPS.

""Teamsters have set a new standard and raised the bar for pay, benefits, and working conditions in the package delivery industry. This is the template for how workers should be paid and protected nationwide, and nonunion companies like Amazon better pay attention,"" O'Brien said.

Unions representing ""essential"" transportation workers including pilots, port workers and delivery drivers are enjoying enhanced bargaining power due to the tight labor market and stronger public support for unions.

In July, pilots at UPS rival FedEx (FDX.N) rejected their tentative contract.

UPS cut its full-year revenue and profitability targets earlier this month, citing higher-than-expected labor costs and business lost during the tumultuous contract talks with the Teamsters.

The company said all local supplemental agreements also have been ratified except one, which will be finalized shortly. Voting results for agreements covering UPS employees under locals 705 and 710 are expected soon.

1,"Title: Source: Idina Menzel Is No Longer Being Managed by Scooter Braun (Exclusive)

Let it go: Idina Menzel is no longer being managed by Scooter Braun.

A source close to the Tony-winning star tells The Hollywood Reporter she parted ways with the talent manager in January after announcing in 2019 that she’d signed with him.

The past few days have been dramatic for Braun: News of Demi Lovato parting ways with the talent manager broke Monday, and last week Puck News reported that Justin Bieber was looking for new management. Shortly after, Braun’s team said the report was false. Rumors about Ariana Grande leaving the manager after a decade bubbled online this week, and J Balvin parted ways with Braun in May.

Breaking news… I’m no longer managing myself — Scott “Scooter” Braun (@scooterbraun) August 22, 2023

Braun addressed the reports on X (formerly Twitter) on Tuesday, writing: “Breaking news… I’m no longer managing myself.”

Menzel, Balvin and Lovato are still listed as music clients on the Scooter Braun Projects website. SB Projects also manages Ozuna, Dan + Shay, Quavo and Ava Max, among others. Braun’s Schoolboy Records includes acts like Carly Rae Jepsen.

Menzel is a Broadway star who’s earned three Tony nominations, winning best actress in a musical in 2004 for Wicked. She achieved pop star-like success after voicing the character of Elsa in 2013’s Frozen, achieving a major hit with the song “Let It Go,” which is 9x platinum (equivalent to selling 9 million units). More recently, Menzel has had roles in Disenchanted, Cinderella and American Murderer. She will also reunite onscreen with Adam Sandler in You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah, after starring opposite him in Uncut Gems.

Ever wished you could do more with Microsoft Excel? Microsoft just announced the release of a public preview of Python in Excel, which would allow users to add Python code directly into a spreadsheet.

This would enable data analysts, engineers, marketers, and students learning data science to work with Python code to perform complex statistical analysis, advanced visualizations, predictive analytics, and machine learning in Excel.

Users will be able to enter Python code directly into cells using the new =PY function, as Python will be integrated directly into the Excel grid, with no need to install additional software.

Microsoft explains that the new functionality leverages the Anaconda distribution of Python, an enterprise geared to data scientists and engineers that is also beginner-friendly. Anaconda includes many pre-packaged libraries and packages like pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, NumPy, and SciPy.

3,"Title: Stocks close mixed, 10-year yield sits near 16-year high: Stock market news today

US stocks closed Tuesday's trading day mixed with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) the only major index to close the day in positive territory while Treasury yields remained a focus for investors.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was the day's laggard, falling about 0.5%, or more than 170 points, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) was off about 0.3%.

The 10-year Treasury yield stood near 4.33% at Tuesday's close, about 2 basis points off its highs of the day, which were a 16-year high. Yields have garnered increased investor attention in recent weeks as both nominal and inflation-adjusted Treasury yields surge towards their highest levels since the financial crisis.

Notable movers on Tuesday included Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), which saw shares close down 24% following a disappointing quarter the company said was impacted by increased theft in its stores.

Macy's (M) stock was also down 14% after the retailer reported increased discounts to clear bloated shelves during the quarter.

All of Neptune's clouds have vanished, and scientists think the sun is to blame.

The disappearance of the wispy, white strands of frozen methane that usually streak Neptune's azure face has been linked to changes in ultraviolet (UV) radiation as the sun 's activity climbs to an 11-year maximum.

The clouds around the solar system's eighth and most distant planet — located roughly 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers) from the sun — began fading in 2019 and were gone without a trace by 2020.

""Even now, four years later, the most recent images we took this past June still show the clouds haven't returned to their former levels,"" Erandi Chavez , a graduate student at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who led the study as an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley, said in a statement . ""This is extremely exciting and unexpected, especially since Neptune's previous period of low cloud activity was not nearly as dramatic and prolonged.""

The sun's activity rises and falls in 11-year cycles, but recently, the sun has been far more active than expected, with sunspot appearances nearly double the number predicted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center . Scientists anticipate that the sun's activity, initially thought to reach its maximum in 2025, could peak as soon as the end of this year .

Astronomers have pegged the loss of cloud cover to the effects of sunlight hitting Neptune's atmosphere. By analyzing data collected by the Hubble Space Telescope, the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, and the Lick Observatory in California, astronomers observed that, following a two-year delay, peaks in the sun's activity generate more cloud cover over Neptune, while lows cause it to dissipate.

What, exactly, is causing the change isn't known for certain. The most likely explanation is that UV light from the sun starts chemical reactions in Neptune's upper atmosphere, ultimately creating the clouds.
