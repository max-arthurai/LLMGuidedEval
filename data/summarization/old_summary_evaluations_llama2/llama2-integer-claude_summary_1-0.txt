 I would give this summary a score of 8 out of 10. It effectively summarizes the key points of the article, including the ratification of the new contract, the pay raises and benefits for UPS workers, and the impact on the company's financial forecasts. However, there are a few areas where the summary could be improved. Firstly, some of the sentences could be shorter and more concise, making it easier for readers to quickly understand the main points. Additionally, the summary could benefit from including more specific details about the contract, such as the exact percentage of workers who voted in favor of the agreement and the specific changes to the wage tiers. Overall, the summary is well-written and informative, but could be further refined for clarity and detail.
