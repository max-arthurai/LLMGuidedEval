 I would give this summary a score of 8 out of 10. It effectively summarizes the article's main points, including the ratification of the UPS contract, the elimination of the two-tier wage system, and the addition of a paid holiday and air conditioning in new truck models. However, there are a few areas where the summary could be improved. Firstly, it would be helpful to provide more context about the significance of the contract ratification and its impact on the labor market. Secondly, the summary could benefit from more specific details about the pay raise and how it compares to previous contracts. Lastly, it would be useful to include information about the reaction of UPS management and employees to the contract ratification.
