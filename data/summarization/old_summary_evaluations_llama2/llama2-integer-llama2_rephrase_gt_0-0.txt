 I would give this summary a score of 8 out of 10. It effectively summarizes the article's main points and provides relevant information about the UPS workers' ratification of a new contract. However, there is room for improvement in terms of providing more specific details about the contract's provisions and how they benefit the workers. Additionally, the summary could be improved by including more context about the labor market and the significance of the contract ratification in the transportation industry.
