 I would give this summary a score of 8 out of 10. It is well-written, informative, and accurately summarizes the article. However, there are a few areas where it could be improved. Firstly, some of the sentences are quite long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow. Additionally, there are a few technical terms used without explanation, such as "two-tier wage system" and "local supplemental agreements," that may be unfamiliar to some readers. Finally, the summary could benefit from a brief conclusion that ties together the main points and highlights their significance. Overall, however, it is a good summary that effectively communicates the key information in the article.
