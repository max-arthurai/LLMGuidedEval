 I would give this summary a score of 8 out of 10. It provides a clear and concise overview of the new contract between UPS and its workers, including the key benefits and changes. Additionally, it highlights the significance of the agreement and its potential impact on the broader labor market. However, to improve the summary, it would be helpful to provide more specific details about the terms of the contract, such as the exact percentage increase in wages and the timeline for implementation. Furthermore, some background information on the negotiations and any notable challenges or concessions made by either party during the bargaining process would add depth to the summary.
