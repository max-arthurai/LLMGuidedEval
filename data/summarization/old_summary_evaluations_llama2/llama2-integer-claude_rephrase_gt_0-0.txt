 I would give this summary a score of 8 out of 10. It provides a clear and concise overview of the new UPS Teamsters contract, including the key benefits and changes for workers. The language is straightforward and easy to understand, and the summary is well-structured and easy to follow. However, to make it a perfect 10, I would suggest a few minor improvements:

* Provide more specific numbers on the pay increases and benefits for part-time workers, as this information is relevant to the audience and could help them better understand the impact of the contract.
* Clarify the context of the quote from Teamsters General President Sean M. O'Brien, as it seems slightly disconnected from the rest of the summary.
* Consider adding a sentence or two about the potential impact of the contract on the broader labor market and the transportation industry, as this could provide additional context and interest for readers.
