 I would give this summary a score of 8 out of 10. It effectively summarizes the article's main points, including the ratification of the UPS Teamsters contract, the elimination of the two-tier wage system, and the addition of a paid holiday and air conditioning to trucks. The summary also highlights the significance of the agreement and its potential impact on other transportation workers. However, to improve the summary, it could benefit from a more concise and direct opening sentence that clearly states the main topic of the article. Additionally, some of the sentences could be simplified for easier readability.
