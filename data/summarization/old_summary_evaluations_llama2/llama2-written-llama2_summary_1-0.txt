 The summary is informative and concise, effectively conveying the key points of the article. It covers the essential aspects of the new UPS contract, including pay raises, elimination of the two-tier wage system, additional paid holiday, and improved working conditions. The summary also highlights the significance of the agreement, both for UPS workers and the broader labor market.

However, there are a few areas where the summary could be improved:

1. Lack of context: While the summary mentions the potential impact of the contract on Christmas deliveries and shipping costs, it would benefit from providing more context about the importance of the UPS contract and its implications for the transportation industry as a whole.
2. Vague language: In some places, the summary uses vague language that could be clarified or expanded upon. For example, instead of saying "ending seniority-based wage tiers," it could say "eliminating the practice of paying newer workers less than veteran workers based on seniority."
3. Missing details: The summary does not provide specific numbers or percentages regarding the pay increases, which would help readers better understand the scope of the agreement. Additionally
