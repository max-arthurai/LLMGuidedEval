 I would give this summary a score of 8 out of 10. It provides a clear and concise overview of the new contract between UPS and the Teamsters union, including the key terms and benefits of the agreement. Additionally, it highlights the significance of the contract in setting a new standard for pay, benefits, and working conditions in the package delivery industry. However, to improve the summary, it could provide more context on the potential impact of the contract on UPS's business and the broader labor market.
