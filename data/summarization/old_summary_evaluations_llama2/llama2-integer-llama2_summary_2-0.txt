 I would give this summary a score of 8 out of 10. It effectively summarizes the article's main points and highlights the key aspects of the new UPS contract, such as pay raises, elimination of the two-tier wage system, and added benefits for workers. Additionally, it mentions the significance of the contract in the context of labor negotiations and transportation industry trends. However, to improve the summary, it could provide more specific details on the terms of the contract and how it compares to previous agreements. Furthermore, it could also offer some analysis or commentary on the potential impact of the contract on the wider labor movement and the transportation industry.
