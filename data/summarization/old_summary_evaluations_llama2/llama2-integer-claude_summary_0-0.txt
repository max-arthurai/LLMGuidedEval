 I would give this summary a score of 8 out of 10. It effectively summarizes the key points of the article, including the ratification of the contract, the wage increases, and the elimination of the two-tier wage system. However, there are a few areas where the summary could be improved. Firstly, some of the sentences could be shorter and more concise, making it easier for readers to quickly understand the main points. Additionally, the summary could benefit from a brief explanation of why the agreement is significant, such as mentioning the potential impact on the labor market and the significance of the deal for the Teamsters union. Overall, the summary is well-written and effectively conveys the essential information, but there is room for improvement to make it even more clear and concise.
