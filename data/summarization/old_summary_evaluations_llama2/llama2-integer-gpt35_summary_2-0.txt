 I would give this summary a score of 8 out of 10. It provides a clear and concise overview of the new contract between UPS and the Teamsters union, including the key provisions and their impact on workers. The summary is well-structured and easy to follow, with appropriate use of transitions and connecting language. However, there are a few areas where the summary could be improved. For example, some of the sentences are quite long and complex, which can make them difficult to understand. Additionally, there are a few minor errors in punctuation and capitalization. Overall, the summary is informative and helpful, but could benefit from a bit more attention to detail and refinement in its presentation.
