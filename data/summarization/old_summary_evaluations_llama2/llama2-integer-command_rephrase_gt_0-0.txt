 I would give this summary a score of 8 out of 10. It effectively summarizes the main points of the article, including the ratification of the UPS Teamsters' contract, the key provisions of the agreement, and the significance of the deal for both the union and non-union workers in the industry. However, there are a few areas where the summary could be improved. Firstly, some of the sentences are quite long and convoluted, making them difficult to follow. Additionally, there are a few minor errors in grammar and punctuation. Overall, the summary is well-written and informative, but could benefit from a bit more editing and refinement.
