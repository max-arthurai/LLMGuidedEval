 I would give this summary a score of 8 out of 10. It effectively summarizes the key points of the article, including the ratification of the contract, the benefits for UPS workers, and the impact on the labor market. However, there are a few areas where the summary could be improved. Firstly, the introductory sentence could be rephrased to make it clearer that the article is about the ratification of a contract between UPS and the Teamsters union. Secondly, some of the sentences could be shorter and more concise, making the summary easier to read. Lastly, the summary could benefit from a brief conclusion that summarizes the main points and highlights their significance.
