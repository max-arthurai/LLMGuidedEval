 I would give this summary a score of 8 out of 10. It provides a clear and concise overview of the new contract between UPS and the Teamsters union, including the key benefits and changes for workers. The language is straightforward and easy to understand, and the summary is well-structured and easy to follow. However, to make it a perfect 10, I would suggest a few minor improvements:

* Provide more specific numbers and data to support the claims made in the summary. For example, instead of saying "significant majority," provide the exact percentage of voters who supported the contract.
* Clarify some of the terms used in the summary, such as "two-tier wage system" and "local supplemental agreements." While these terms may be familiar to those in the industry, they may not be immediately understood by a general audience.
* Consider adding more context or background information on the negotiations and the significance of the agreement. This could help readers better understand the impact of the contract and why it's important.
