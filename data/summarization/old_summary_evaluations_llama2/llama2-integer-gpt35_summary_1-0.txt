 I would give this summary a score of 8 out of 10. It effectively summarizes the article's main points, including the ratification of the UPS workers' contract, the elimination of the two-tier wage system, and the additional benefits provided by the deal. However, there are a few areas where the summary could be improved. For example, it would be helpful to provide more context about the significance of the contract deal and its impact on the labor market. Additionally, the summary could benefit from more specific examples of the benefits provided by the contract, rather than just mentioning them generally. Overall, the summary is well-written and accurately conveys the information in the article, but there is room for improvement.
