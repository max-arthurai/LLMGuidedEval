 I would give this summary a score of 8 out of 10. It effectively summarizes the article's main points while maintaining a neutral tone. However, there is room for improvement in terms of providing more context and clarity on certain points. For example, the summary could explain what the two-tier wage system for drivers at UPS entails, or provide more information on the impact of the new contract on the company's labor costs. Additionally, it would be helpful to include specific examples or quotes from the article to support the summary's points.
