 I would give this summary a score of 8 out of 10. It provides a clear and concise overview of the new UPS contract and its benefits for workers, and highlights the significance of the agreement in setting a new standard for pay and working conditions in the package delivery industry. However, there are a few areas where the summary could be improved. Firstly, it would be helpful to provide more context on the background of the contract negotiations and the key issues at stake. Additionally, the summary could benefit from including more specific details on the terms of the contract, such as the exact wage increases and benefits provided to workers. Finally, it would be useful to include a statement from UPS management regarding their perspective on the contract and how they plan to implement its provisions.
