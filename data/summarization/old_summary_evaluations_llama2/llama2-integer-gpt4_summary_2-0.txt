 I would give this summary a score of 8 out of 10. It effectively summarizes the article's main points, including the ratification of the UPS contract, the elimination of the two-tier wage system, and the various benefits and pay increases included in the agreement. However, there are a few areas where the summary could be improved. For example, it does not provide specific details on the percentage of members who voted or the exact language of the contract. Additionally, it could benefit from more context on the significance of the agreement and its impact on the labor market. Nonetheless, overall, the summary is well-written and accurately conveys the essential information from the article.
