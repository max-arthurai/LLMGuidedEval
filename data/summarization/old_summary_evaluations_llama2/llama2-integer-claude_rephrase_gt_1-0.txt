 I would give this summary a score of 8 out of 10. It effectively summarizes the main points of the article, including the ratification of the new contract, the elimination of the two-tier wage system, and the additional benefits provided to UPS workers. However, there are a few areas where the summary could be improved. Firstly, it would be helpful to provide more context about the significance of the contract ratification and its impact on the labor market. Secondly, the summary could benefit from more specific examples of the improvements secured by the Teamsters union. Lastly, it would be useful to include information about the reaction of UPS management and employees to the new contract. Despite these limitations, the summary is well-written and accurately conveys the essential details of the article.
