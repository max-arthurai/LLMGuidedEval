 I would give this summary a score of 8 out of 10. It effectively summarizes the article's main points, including the ratification of the UPS contract, the elimination of the two-tier wage system, and the addition of air conditioning to new trucks. The summary also highlights the significance of the contract in setting a new standard for pay and benefits in the package delivery industry. However, to improve the summary, it would be helpful to provide more specific details about the contract's provisions and how they benefit UPS workers. Additionally, a brief mention of the impact of the contract on UPS's business and the broader labor market would add depth to the summary.
