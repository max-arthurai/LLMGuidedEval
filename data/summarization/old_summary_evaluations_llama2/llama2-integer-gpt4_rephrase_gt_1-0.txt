 I would give this summary a score of 8 out of 10. It effectively summarizes the main points of the article, including the ratification of the UPS Teamsters contract, the key provisions of the contract, and the significance of the agreement for both UPS workers and the broader labor movement. The language is clear and concise, and the summary is well-structured. However, to reach a perfect 10, the summary could benefit from a stronger opening sentence that sets the context for the reader and provides more background information on the UPS Teamsters union and its negotiations with the company. Additionally, some minor editing errors (e.g., "non-unionized corporations" instead of "non-union companies") could be corrected to further improve the clarity and accuracy of the summary.
