 The summary is informative and effectively conveys the key points of the article. It covers the main aspects of the new contract between UPS and the Teamsters union, including pay raises, elimination of the two-tier wage system, and improved working conditions. Additionally, it highlights the significance of the agreement and its potential impact on other transportation workers and nonunion companies like Amazon.

However, there are a few areas where the summary could be improved:

1. Clarity: Some sentences are quite long and complex, making them difficult to understand. For example, the first sentence contains several clauses that make it hard to follow. Breaking up long sentences into simpler ones would improve readability.
2. Specific details: While the summary mentions the pay raise and elimination of the two-tier wage system, it doesn't provide specific numbers or percentages until later in the text. Providing these details earlier in the summary would help readers better understand the significance of the agreement.
3. Context: While the summary explains the importance of the agreement for transportation workers and nonunion companies, it doesn't provide much context about the history of the dispute or the challenges faced during negotiations
