UPS Teamsters Union has ratified their new 5-year contract. 86.3% of voting members supported the contract, which raises pay, eliminates a two-tier wage system, provides another paid holiday, ends forced overtime, and adds A/C to trucks. After tumultuous contract talks, teamsters highlighted how the union's actions were successful and should be paid attention to by nonunion companies.
